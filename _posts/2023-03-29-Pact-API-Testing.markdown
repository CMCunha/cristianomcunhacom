Good to see you again :)

I though that following one of the past articles called: ["To Mock or not to Mock, that is the question"](https://cristianomcunha.com/2mock-or-not-2mock/) we could dive in a little more and try to understand the API testing panorama.

With the evolution of applications towards micro-services 

# What is an API?
Application Platfrom Interface (API) by definition is a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.


# Challenges in API usage
API like any other approach has its challenges, handling breaking changes when you have multiple clients using it, how to know how mnay clients are using it and what are the versions they are using? How to handle multiple versions? How different is API coding then a normal applications? Does it exposes your company more or in the contrary helps others use what you have available building their cusotm experience.

# How to validate APIs


## Mutliple versions
## External dependencies
## Multiple dependencies

# Why PACT?

## Test using PACT

# Final considerations
Using contract testing prof to be very helpful although if it is not adopted by all teams (or the majority of them) you will not get all the advantages of using it.
PACT adoption must be for all teams

 
See you in my next article ;)
